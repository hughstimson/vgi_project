<h2>A VGI project with <a href="http://edmontonpipelines.org/">Edmonton Pipelines</a><h2>

<p>With this project I am looking to learn how to build a map that:
<ol>
<li>Supports user contributions of point, line, and polygon;</li>
<li>Allows the user to label and describe their geometry;</li>
<li>Saves the geometry and metadata in a database;</li>
<li>Supports the moderation of contributions.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>To the best of my understanding, the stack that will best support this workflow is:
<ol>
<li>CartoDB: As the DB where contributions will be written and stored for moderation via SQL.</li>
<li>MapBox: To provide a custom (cartocss) base-map.</li>
<li>LeafLet: As the user interface and to provide the Draw Plugin as well as the pan, zoom and layer control.</li>
<li>HTML/CSS: Basic web functionality, look and feel.</li>
<li>Javascript: To power the map and LeafLet plugin.</li>

</ol>
</p>


<p>Finally, I am new here. If you have any comments or criticism please let me know.</p>
